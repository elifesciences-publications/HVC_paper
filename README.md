1. Contents
-------------------
This package contains the raw data files as well as source code required for
the analysis. In case of questions or difficulties running the code, please contact
kornfeld@neuro.mpg.de

2. Provided data
-------------------
2.1 Registered raw EM dataset

A streaming configuration file (j0256.conf) is provided for KNOSSOS (www.knossostool.org) that can be used
to easily access all image data and perform your own tracings in the dataset. If the hosting source
changes, an updated streaming configuration file will be provided on github.

The configuration file can also be used together with the knossosDataset class provided
in the public knossos_utils package to directly work with the dataset (e.g. download it, convert
to an image stack, etc).
